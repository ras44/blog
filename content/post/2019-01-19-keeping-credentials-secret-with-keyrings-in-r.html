<h2>Keeping credentials secret</h2>
<p>When accessing an API or database in R, it is often necessary to provide credentials such as login name and password.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure: Providing credentials via an interactive prompt</p>
</div>
<p>Often it is also more convenient to provide credentials programatically in an R script, but best practices<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As with every programming language, it is important to <strong>avoid publishing code with your credentials in plain text</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how can we provide credentials without putting them in the script itself? There are a variety of options described in RStudio’s <a href="https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/">“Databases using R”</a>.</p>
<p>Two cases that we will focus on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simply prompting for credentials via rstudioapi
<ul>
<li>suitable for simple credential management</li>
</ul></li>
<li>storing sets of encrypted credentials in a local file via the R keyring package
<ul>
<li>suitable for more complicated credential management</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="prompting-for-a-username-and-password" class="section level2">
<h2>Prompting for a username and password</h2>
<p>If an R Script requires only one set of credentials and those credentials are easy to remember, it may be easiest to prompt the user for them using <strong>rstudioapi</strong>.</p>
<p>This method works well if the user is able to easily remember their credentials. A typical example would be prompting users for their username and password to access a corporate database:</p>
<pre><code>username &lt;- rstudioapi::showPrompt(title = &quot;User Name&quot;, message = &quot;username&quot;, default = &quot;&quot;)
password &lt;- rstudioapi::askForPassword(&quot;Database password&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If these credentials tend to change over time, using this method for these credentials may be even more convenient that using keyrings.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-keyring-package" class="section level2">
<h2>R Keyring package</h2>
<p>A more sophisticated option is to use the R keyring package to store and access encrypted credentials locally. This might be more suitable if multiple credentials exist to access a variety of services (think multiple access tokens). With keyrings, one password unlocks the keyring which then provides access to all the credentials.</p>
<p>To use the keyring package, we only have to install and load the keyring package<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and define three strings: the keyring name, a keyring service, and the username that we want to associate our secret credentials with.</p>
<p>In the below example, we will create a keyring name <code>my_keyring</code>, with credentials to access <code>my_database</code> as <code>my_username</code>. We first create a <code>backend_file</code> type of keyring which will store the encrypted credentials in the user’s home directory ( <code>~/.config/r-keyring</code> on Linux, <code>~/Library/Application Support/r-keyring/</code> on Mac). With <code>keyring_create</code>, we prompt for the password that will unlock the keyring. Finally, we store a credential in the keyring with <code>set</code> before locking it with <code>keyring_lock</code>.</p>
<pre><code>library(keyring)

# Set variables to be used in keyring.
kr_name &lt;- &quot;my_keyring&quot;
kr_service &lt;- &quot;my_database&quot;
kr_username &lt;- &quot;my_username&quot;

# Create a keyring and add an entry using the variables above
kb &lt;- keyring::backend_file$new()
# Prompt for the keyring password, used to unlock keyring
kb$keyring_create(kr_name)
# Prompt for the credential to be stored in the keyring
kb$set(kr_service, username=kr_username, keyring=kr_name)
# Lock the keyring
kb$keyring_lock(kr_name)

# The encrypted keyring file is now stored at ~/.config/r-keyring/ and can be
# accessed by any R program that provides the keyring password</code></pre>
<p>We can store credentials for multiple usernames per service, and multiple services per keyring. This is ideal in the case of an application that must access a variety of services via access tokens. The encrypted credentials file can either be published with the code, or perhaps for extra security, distributed via a separate channel.</p>
</div>
<div id="retrieving-credentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Retrieving credentials</h2>
<p>To retrieve credentials, we set the same three variables and use the keyring <code>get()</code> function, which will prompt us for the keyring password that we set when we called <code>create</code>. A retrieval script follows:</p>
<pre><code>library(keyring)
library(DBI)

# Set variables to be used in keyring.
kr_name &lt;- &quot;my_keyring&quot;
kr_service &lt;- &quot;my_database&quot;
kr_username &lt;- &quot;my_username&quot;

# Output the stored password: normally you would not want to do this
keyring::backend_file$new()$get(service = kr_service,
                                user = kr_username,
                                keyring = kr_name)


# Establish connection to Teradata retrieving the password from the keyring.
dbConnect(drv = odbc::odbc(),
                dsn = &quot;my_dsn&quot;, # set DSN options in ~/.odbc.ini
                pwd = keyring::backend_file$new()$get(service = kr_service,
                                                      user = kr_username,
                                                      keyring = kr_name))
</code></pre>
<p>With this, we are able to retrieve arbitrary credentials for a particular username and service, allowing us to manage much more complicated sets of credentials with a single password.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>What is the best way to ensure that plaintext credentials are not published with code? If your code relies on a limited number of credentials, an interactive prompt may be the more suitable choice: code users know what their username and password are and can easily enter them interactively.</p>
<p>If the code requires multiple, hard-to-remember, or cumbersome to provide credentials, you might want to consider using keyrings. Users will only need to provide one password, which will unlock the keyring and provide access to all credentials.</p>
